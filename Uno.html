<h1>I turn off my lights to read since the dark is pretty chill</h1>

<p>
    Yeah, I don't know where to start
    <br>
    How do you admit that you're falling apart?
    <br>
    I mean, how will I admit that I'm falling apart?
    <br>
    My mother's gonna worry but I'm fine in my heart
    <br>
    I've lived the words that I've said
    <br>
    And I live with a voice that tends to tell me that I'm shit in my head
    <br>
    And well, maybe I should fuck it and be happy instead
    <br>
    I should just say, "Fuck it, " and be happy instead, right?
    <br>
    Right
    <br>
    'Cause there's a lot of people tryna tell me how to deal with myself
    <br>
    But I'm not gonna listen if you mention my health
    <br>
    I don't care, don't tell me and don't text me
    <br>
    'Cause that kind of shit upsets me, just kind of affects me
    <br>
    And it's bringing me down, and I'm not gonna lie
    <br>
    These days, I prefer to just not be outside
    <br>
    And these days, I just end up spendin' all of my time
    <br>
    With my girlfriend, but to be honest, I think that's alright
    <br>
    'Cause time keeps rollin' and I'm just makin' songs
    <br>
    I'm doing my best
    <br>
    Still find myself stressed
    <br>
    And I'm no longer sure where I belong
    <br>
    I'm starting to rust
    <br>
    Don't know who to trust
    <br>
    Some people concentrate on style too much
    <br>
    But I think I just force myself to smile too much
    <br>
    And that should soon end for the best
    <br>
    I wanna live my life with no stress
    <br>
    Love life and feel blessed, like
    <br>
    It's kind of funny on the inside
    <br>
    I'm tryna be a man, but really I'm just a little child, shit
    <br>
    And that's pretty much it
    <br>
    Yeah that's pretty much it
    <br>
    (Is there anything else?)
    <br>
    Oh yeah
    <br>
    My jaw hurts a lot because I grind it with stress (mhm?)
    <br>
    I was an idiot recently and lost a lot of my friends (naw)
    <br>
    Nothing brings me joy and nothing makes me smile
    <br>
    Being at school makes me aware of how I haven't been myself in awhile (oh)
    <br>
    And I wonder what it was like to be eleven?
    <br>
    Wonder if there's such a thing as life after death, such a thing as heaven? (Why?)
    <br>
    And every now and then I think about the fact that I'd become a legend if I died at 27
